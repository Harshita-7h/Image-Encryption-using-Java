     Information security is a set of strategies for managing the processes, tools and policies necessary to prevent, detect, document and counter threats to digital and non-digital information. Infosec responsibilities include establishing a set of business processes that will protect information assets regardless of how the information is formatted or whether it is in transit, is being processed or is at rest in storage.

# Cryptography
    
    Cryptography is an art of using mathematics to encrypt or decrypt data. It is a technique of making a cryptosystem that is capable of providing information security. It enables us to store sensitive information or transmit it across an insecure network (like Internet) so that it cannot be read by anyone except the authorized user.
    
    While cryptography is an art of securing data, “Cryptanalysis” is an art of analysing and breaking the secure communication. Cryptology is a combination of both Cryptography and Cryptanalysis.
    
# Encryption
     
     Encryption is the method by which plaintext or any other type of data is converted from a readable form to an encoded version that can only be decoded by another entity if they have access to a decryption key. Encryption is one of the most important methods for providing data security, especially for end-to-end protection of data transmitted across networks.
  
     Encryption is widely used on the internet to protect user information being sent between a browser and a server, including passwords, payment information and other personal information that should be considered private. Organizations and individuals also commonly use encryption to protect sensitive data stored on computers, servers and mobile devices like phones or tablets.

# Decryption
     
     Decryption is the process of transforming data that has been rendered unreadable through encryption back to its unencrypted form. In decryption, the system extracts and converts the garbled data and transforms it to texts and images that are easily understandable not only by the reader but also by the system. Decryption may be accomplished manually or automatically. It may also be performed with a set of keys or passwords.
  
     One of the foremost reasons for implementing an encryption-decryption system is privacy. As information travels over the World Wide Web, it becomes subject to scrutiny and access from unauthorized individuals or organizations. As a result, data is encrypted to reduce data loss and theft. Some of the common items that are encrypted include email messages, text files, images, user data and directories. The person in charge of decryption receives a prompt or window in which a password may be entered to access encrypted information.
